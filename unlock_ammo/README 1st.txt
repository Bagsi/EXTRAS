Updated for server version - v0.9.19SP2

These files will auto unlock any vehicle in a trader marker on server restart and remove ammo from any purchased vehicles or player owned vehicles if it has mounted guns.

Simple to install
1. Download files
2. unpack exile_server.pbo
2. Replace overwrite files in exile_server\code (yes can be done via mpmission but why waste mission space)
3. repack exile_server.pbo
4. Load server and your done.. Add note to server loading that vehicles unlock in traders.
